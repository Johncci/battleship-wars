## <u>**Gameplay**</u> ##

Battleship down is an enjoybale game of chance. In my version of the game, the player enters their name and then the location of their ships. The computers ships are automatically generated. The players ships are represented by a # sign and the computers ships are not visible. The player will enter co_ordinates in the terminal and the selected square will be represented by an X. Hits are indicated by a *.
